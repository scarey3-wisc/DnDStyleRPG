This game (currently unnamed) is an RPG in the artistic style of the Fire Emblem games and the tradition of Dungeons and Dragons.
I particularly wanted to focus on some technical challenges with moving characters. Turn based RPG maps often only allow units 
to move in combinations of vertical and horizontal steps on a cartesian grid. I wanted to keep the cartesian grid, but enable movement 
to follow the most direct path from point A to point B while simultaneously respecting obstacles that may be in the way. Ie,
a character on open ground should be able to walk in a straight line in any direction while a character in a room should move around
obstacles in the most direct path.

Look in the Screenshots Folder for examples of the game's visual style and mechanics.

To load the game, open index.html in any web browser (tested primarily in Chrome). Spacebar, Enter key, and Arrow keys used to
navigate through conversations
Left click playable units to see and select their actions.

See js folder for source code:
main.js contains the "window.onload" functions that initialize the game. If you want to change the starting point, look at the
initGame function in main.js. 
"Map Files" contains .js files which set up map terrain and URLs
"Scenario Files" contains .js files which set up battles and conversations

If you want to add a new .js file, be sure to also add a <script> tag loading it in index.html.
