Open index.html in any browser to see the game!

Whenever you add a new Javascript file, be sure to also add a <script> tag in index.html to include that javascript

Most code can be found in the js folder. Main.js sets up the initial state of the game, so look there if you want to start the game
with different scenarios / conversations.
